## Explanation
Otsu's thresholding is an automatic threshold selection method that calculates the optimal threshold value by minimizing the intra-class variance. It is particularly effective for images with a bimodal histogram.

## Algorithm and Equations
1. **Intra-Class Variance**:
   $$
   \sigma^2_w(T) = w_0(T) \sigma^2_0(T) + w_1(T) \sigma^2_1(T)
   $$
   where \( w_0(T) \) and \( w_1(T) \) are the weights of the two classes, and \( \sigma^2_0(T) \) and \( \sigma^2_1(T) \) are the variances of the two classes.

## Pros and Cons
- **Pros**:
  - Automatic threshold selection.
  - Effective for bimodal histograms.
- **Cons**:
  - May not perform well for images with more than two peaks in the histogram.
  - Computationally intensive for large images.

## When to Use
- Use when you need an automatic thresholding method for images with a clear bimodal histogram.

## Sample Code Implementation

Here's a simple implementation in Python using OpenCV:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Load the image
img = cv2.imread('image.jpg', 0)

# Apply Otsu's thresholding
_, otsu_thresh_img = cv2.threshold(img, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)

# Display the results
plt.subplot(121), plt.imshow(img, cmap='gray'), plt.title('Original Image')
plt.subplot(122), plt.imshow(otsu_thresh_img, cmap='gray'), plt.title('Otsu Thresholding')
plt.show()
